    <h2 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> About me</h2>
    <p style="color:darkblue">My name is Jack Lieder and I am currently 23 years old. I graduated from Boston College in 2022
        with a BA in Economics. I have work experience in tax, marketing, life insurance,
        investment banking, and education. So you're probably thinking, why would I be taking a web development course?
        I have always been interested in computer science and programming. I started programming in college when I
        learned stata and R in my economics statistics classes. Theses courses inspired me to enroll in a highly recommended
        Coursera class called "Python For Everybody" the summer after my junior year of college. This course opened my eyes to world of programming
        and how it can be used to improve our lives. Fast forward about 18 months, I accepted an investment 
        banking role with a firm, a firm that is missing a helpful tool - a website. DING! DING! Lightbulb moment. So, at the very least
        I hope to build a prototype website for the firm by learninhg web development in this bootcamp. I look forward to improving
        my programming skills and improving my clients lives or buisinesses in the future. </p>
